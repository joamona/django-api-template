# Start developping
To avoid to install Pyhton and its dependencies in your computer, you can 
use the interpreter in the container. You can achieve this with Visual Studio Code (VS).

- Start the services: docker compose up.
- Open VS.
- Press Ctrl + Shift + p.
- Paste the following: Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container.
- Select the container *-djangoapi-1.
- A new VS code window is started.
- In the terminal, change to the folder /home/$username, where the source code is.
- Select the interpreter: Ctrl + Shift + p, and type python select interpreter, and select the interpreter in the container. There are two interpreters. Select the one in 
/usr/local/bib/python. This one is the one that has all the pythin mackages installed: Django, GeoDjango, etc. In this way VS will help you to code.
- Now, you can modify the source files, and create new Django apps from the VS connected to the container.
- To create a new app, in the terminal, in the VS connected to the container, type: 

    python manage.py startapp mynewapp

# Debugging

RemoteDebug has been configured in the VS project and in settings.py. To stop the execution in a line:

- If you change the username in the file .env, you musy change the file .vscode/launch.json:

      "remoteRoot": "/home/joamona"   <-- Change joamona to your username

- Put a breackpoint.
- Set, in djangoapi/settings.py, the REMOTE_DEBUG to true.
